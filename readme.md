<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About Crossy

Crossy is a powerful crosshair overlay that works with any game or application. Whether you're playing an FPS that doesn't have crosshair customization or need precision targeting in other applications, Crossy provides a solution that's both highly customizable and incredibly lightweight.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Getting started with Crossy is quick and simple.

### Prerequisites

* Windows 10 or higher, macOS, or Linux

### Installation

1. Download the latest version of Crossy from the [releases page](https://github.com/ZeroxyDev/crossy/releases)
2. Run the installer
3. Launch Crossy from your desktop or start menu

When running the installer of Crossy application, you may encounter a message indicating that the **application is not signed**. This is a common occurrence for unsigned software. Follow these steps to proceed securely:

1. Upon seeing the "application not signed" message, click on "More Info."
2. Look for the option that allows you to continue or run the application despite the lack of a digital signature.
3. Click on "Run Anyway" to initiate the application safely.

This message is a standard security caution, and by following these steps, you can confidently launch the Crossy application.

<!-- USAGE -->
## Usage

Using Crossy is straightforward:

1. Launch Crossy
2. Design your crosshair or select from presets
3. Use the global shortcut (default: Ctrl+Alt+X) to toggle the overlay
4. Enjoy a customized crosshair in any game or application

### Crosshair Editor Workflow

Crossy's editor provides a step-by-step process to create your perfect crosshair:

<div align="center">
  <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start with a basic crosshair template</p>
  <img src="public/assets/images/screenshots/edit-crosshair-init.png" alt="Initial Crosshair" width="80%">
  
  <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Adjust parameters to refine your design</p>

  <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Fine-tune colors and details for the perfect result</p>
  <img src="public/assets/images/screenshots/edit-crosshair-final.png" alt="Final Crosshair" width="80%">
</div>

Crossy runs silently in your system tray when minimized. Click the tray icon to open the interface anytime you want to adjust settings.

### Quick Tips:

- **For most games**: Crossy works out of the box with no special configuration
- **For fullscreen games**: Consider using borderless windowed mode for best results
- **For competitive games**: Check if using external crosshairs is permitted by the game's terms of service
